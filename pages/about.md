My name is Isaac Broyles. In my day job, I work as a Software Engineer. In my free time, I enjoy studying and training in art. 

I'd like to use my technical skills to share as much of my journey as possible. The hope is that I can share valuable resources I find, and inspire you to pursue your own passion.

If you are interested in what I share, please consider following me on the social platforms of your choice.
