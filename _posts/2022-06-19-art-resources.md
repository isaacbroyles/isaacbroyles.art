Here's links to art resources I've found valuable.

## Books

* [Figure Drawing for All It's Worth - Andrew Loomis](https://amzn.to/3xH5d72){:target="\_blank"} - This has been my primary study material for figure drawing. I worked through this book page by page, redrawing many of the poses in here as per Loomis' method. I feel like my figure drawing improved significantly after going through this book.

* [Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain](https://amzn.to/3zzeiA1){:target="\_blank"} - I have mixed feelings about this book, but I would still recommend it to very early beginners. It has some good lessons, but I personally felt like I needed to quickly move on from the lessons in this book.

## Supplies

## Online Resources

* [RadioRunner's Curriculum for the Solo Artist - Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/){:target="\_blank"} - RadioRunner compiled an awesome list of online resources a few years back, and posted it to Reddit. I've used this list as a hub to find some of the best resources for the topics I want to study. Strongly recommend going through it.

* [Croquis Cafe](https://croquis.cafe/){:target="\_blank"} - Really helpful resource for quality poses.
